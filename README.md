# OtherStudyPublic

This repo contain notes from books which I am currently working on or have 
worked through. The books/notes which belong in this category are those 
which I have not done enough to warrant it's own directory.

If I have at least three subfolders of similar type of technology, I will
move them into their own repo (like I have done for Cpp, Python, 
CompeteAlgo, etc...)
